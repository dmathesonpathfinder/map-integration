## Attack Vector Analysis

### Most Likely Attack Scenarios

1. **Data Harvesting** (Probability: HIGH)
   - Automated scraping of clinic data from console output
   - Competitor intelligence gathering
   - Privacy law violations

2. **Information Disclosure** (Probability: MEDIUM)
   - Log file access revealing sensitive data
   - Error message exploitation
   - System path disclosure

3. **Injection Attacks** (Probability: LOW-MEDIUM)
   - XSS through weak input filtering
   - SQL injection if WordPress security compromised
   - File inclusion vulnerabilities

---

## Business Impact Assessment

### High Risk Scenarios
- **Regulatory Fines:** GDPR violations ($20M+ potential)
- **Data Breach:** Clinic information compromise
- **Service Disruption:** API rate limiting issues
- **Reputation Damage:** Security incident disclosure

### Medium Risk Scenarios  
- **Data Corruption:** Through input validation bypass
- **System Information Leakage:** Internal structure exposure
- **Performance Issues:** Resource exhaustion attacks
