  - [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
  - [ ] Verify limits are appropriate
  - [ ] Check for bypass possibilities

### Configuration Security
- [ ] **WordPress Integration**
  - [ ] Verify hooks are properly implemented
  - [ ] Check for any unsafe WordPress function usage
  - [ ] Test plugin activation/deactivation security
- [ ] **Security Headers**
  - [ ] Verify CSP headers are properly configured
  - [ ] Check X-Frame-Options implementation
  - [ ] Confirm other security headers are present

## Vulnerability Testing

### Automated Testing
- [ ] **Run Enhanced Security Test Suite**
  - [ ] Execute `enhanced-security-tests.php`
  - [ ] Review all test results
  - [ ] Investigate any failures
- [ ] **Static Code Analysis**
  - [ ] Use PHP security scanners if available
  - [ ] Check for common vulnerability patterns
  - [ ] Review dependency security

### Manual Testing
- [ ] **Authentication Testing**
  - [ ] Test admin login bypass attempts
  - [ ] Verify session management security
  - [ ] Check for insecure password handling
- [ ] **Authorization Testing**
  - [ ] Test horizontal privilege escalation
  - [ ] Test vertical privilege escalation
  - [ ] Verify user role restrictions
- [ ] **Input Testing**
  - [ ] Fuzz test all input fields
  - [ ] Test for buffer overflow conditions
  - [ ] Check file upload security (if applicable)

### Penetration Testing Scenarios
- [ ] **External Attacker Perspective**
  - [ ] Test for information disclosure
  - [ ] Attempt unauthorized data access
  - [ ] Test for remote code execution possibilities
- [ ] **Malicious User Scenarios**
  - [ ] Test with compromised user account
  - [ ] Attempt to access other users' data
  - [ ] Test bulk operation abuse
